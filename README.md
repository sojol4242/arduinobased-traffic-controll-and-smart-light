# Arduino based automatic traffic controll and smart lighting using ultrasonic sensor and ldr module

The Arduino-based automatic traffic control and smart lighting project using ultrasonic sensors and LDR modules can be described as follows:

### Traffic Control: The ultrasonic sensors are placed on opposite sides of the road and are used to detect the presence of vehicles. The sensor sends out a pulse of ultrasonic sound and measures the time it takes for the sound to bounce back after hitting an object. Based on this information, the Arduino calculates the distance of the object from the sensor and controls the traffic lights accordingly.

### Smart Lighting: In addition to controlling the traffic lights, the project also includes a smart lighting system that turns on the street lights only when it is necessary. The LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) modules are used to detect the ambient light level. When the light level drops below a certain threshold, indicating nighttime, the street lights are turned on.

### Programming: The project is programmed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and the C++ programming language. The code reads the data from the ultrasonic sensors and LDR modules, processes it, and controls the traffic lights and street lights accordingly.

### Components: The project requires an Arduino board, ultrasonic sensors, LDR modules, traffic lights, street lights, and additional components such as resistors, transistors, and wires.

Overall, the Arduino-based automatic traffic control and smart lighting project using ultrasonic sensors and LDR modules provides a smart and energy-efficient solution for controlling traffic and lighting in urban areas. By using both ultrasonic sensors and LDR modules, the system can accurately detect the presence of vehicles and pedestrians and adjust the lighting accordingly.
